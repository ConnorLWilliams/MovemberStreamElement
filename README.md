# MovemberStreamElement
Plugin to create a custom widget for a friend streaming for Movember

To Use:
Run Soupify (You need an ngrok account to allow the Flask server to be accessed by the Stream Elements widget)

You will see an ngrok address when Soupify is run.
Put that address into the .js file where it says, and make a custom widget in Stream Elements.
